# Submit assets to Forge

Forge is a repository of reusable software assets that help overcome technical challenges and helps to solve business use cases. OutSystems enables you to easily and quickly learn how to build and share an asset in self-service and scale the number of out-of-the-box solutions in the community. Users who build assets in their organization can submit them seamlessly, while guided to follow the standards required by the Forge.

The following diagram shows the asset submission journey. The journey is slightly different for new assets and updates to existing assets.

When you submit a new asset, it gets reviewed by the OutSystems Forge team to make sure it meets the requirements. The asset is added to the Forge Repository, and from ODC Portal, you can see it in Forge and edit the information on the detail page. The asset is only visible to you (the owner) and not to users outside your organization. Once it is approved, all users outside your organization can access your asset. Users see an **Install** button on the asset. If it's a new version, users see an **Update** button, indicating that a new version of the asset is available to install.

## Prerequisites

To submit an asset, your asset must meet the following prerequisites:

* Asset names must be unique. The name can't be the same as a name used for a previously submitted Forge asset.
* Submit any dependencies first because you can’t proceed with submission if you’re missing a dependency.
* Assets must be versioned.
* Assets must have a short description that you can edit in ODC Studio.
* The asset name of this version must be the same as its previous version.

## Submit an asset to Forge

You can submit assets to Forge without needing to upload your asset. When you access Forge, you see a list of developed assets to select from your organizations context.

By default, the Asset name, the icon, and the short description are the ones defined during the development. You can change them in ODC Studio and submit a new version with the changes. The short description displays on the asset's card.

1. Log into ODC Portal and select **Forge**, from the left-side menu. A list of assets available to install on your organization displays.  
1. On the top right, click the **Submit to Forge** button. A list of assets developed in your organization displays.
1. From this list of assets, select the one you want to submit.
1. Enter a detailed description of your asset. Make sure it fully describes the asset's features and the problem(s) it solves.
1. Add any limitations that might exist, such as images might not size correctly in some browsers.
1. Add images that best illustrate the asset's features, main use cases, and behavior.
1. Add the team contact.
1. Add clear and concise documentation to guide developers on how to install and configure the asset along with general instructions on how to use it.
1. Click **Submit** to finalize the process.

## Submit a new asset version to Forge

When an asset gets updated, resubmit it to Forge to share the changes. The updated asset must have the same name as the original asset.

Follow these steps to submit a new version of your asset:

1. On the top right, click the **Submit to Forge** button. A list of assets developed in your organization displays.
1. From this list, select the asset with the new version that you want to submit.
1. Enter release notes that describe the changes you made to the asset.
1.Review the detailed description and any limitations. If necessary, edit the information.
1. Review the images that best illustrate the asset's features, main use cases, and behavior.
1. Optionally, add or edit the team contact.
1. Edit the documentation of the asset (if needed).
1. Click **Submit** to finalize the process.
