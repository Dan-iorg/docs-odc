# Built-in functions

When designing the business logic of your apps, you can use built-in functions. They are available in the **Built-in Functions** folder of the expression editor.

* [Math](<math.md>)
* [Numeric](<numeric.md>)
* [Text](<text.md>)
* [Date and Time](<dateandtime.md>)
* [Data Conversion](<data-conversion.md>)
* [Format](<format.md>)
* [Email](<email.md>)
* [URL](<url.md>)
* [Organization](<organization.md>)

Built-in functions are designed to avoid raising exceptions when executed. If an issue occurs during the execution of a built-in function, OutSystems returns the default value of the output data type.
