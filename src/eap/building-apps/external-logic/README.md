# External Libraries SDK README

The SDK is part of the OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) External Logic feature that you use to extend your apps built in the OutSystems visual language with custom code.

Use of this SDK is the first step in extending an ODC app with custom code. You use it to decorate the code of a C# .NET 6 project with SDK attributes that map to OutSystems visual language elements.

## Prerequisites

* [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.
* An IDE that supports building .NET 6 projects. For example, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Jet Brains Rider.
* Basic knowledge of C# programming concepts.

## Usage

You can start developing external logic for an ODC app from scratch or using one of the provided templates.

### From scratch

Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, for example:

1. From the **Create a new project** window select the **Class Library** template.

1. Give the project a name, for example `ClassLibrary1`. You must select **.NET 6.0 (Long-term support)** as the framework. Click **Create**.

1. From the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click on the project name and click **Manage NuGet packages...** Search for `OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK`, select the result and click **Install**.

1. Create a public interface containing the methods you want to expose as server actions to your ODC apps and libraries. Then decorate it with the `OSInterface` attribute. For example,

        using OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK;

        namespace MyCompany
        {
            [OSInterface]
            public interface IMyLibrary
            {
                public string SayHello(string name);
                public string SayGoodbye(string name);
            }
        }

1. Create a public class implementing that interface. For example,

        namespace MyCompany
        {
            public class MyLibrary : IMyLibrary
            {
                public string SayHello(string name) {
                    return $"Hello, {name}";
                }

                public string SayGoodbye(string name) {
                    return $"Goodbye, {name}";
                }
            }
        }
 
    The exposed methods can only have:

    * Basic .NET types: `string`, `int`, `long`, `bool`, `byte[]`, `decimal`, `float`, `double`, `DateTime`.
    * Structs decorated with the `OSStructure` attribute.
    * Lists (any type inheriting from [IEnumerable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable?view=net-6.0)) of any of the previous two types.

1. Once you are finished with the code, save the project and publish it. For example, right-click **Solution ClassLibrary1** and click **Open in Terminal**. Run command `dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained false`.
    
    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    The published code runs in a Linux container.
    
    </div>

1. Zip the contents of publish output folder (normally this is, for example, `./ClassLibrary1/bin/Release/net6.0/publish/*`) to the root folder of a ZIP file called, for example, `ExternalLibrary.zip`, the name of your external library.

1. Upload the ZIP file to the ODC Portal. See the [External Logic feature documentation](intro.md) for guidance on how to do this.

### From a template

#### IBAN (International Bank Account Number) checker: Basic version

1. Download and unzip the [basic template file from the SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/OutSystems/OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK-templates/blob/main/basic_template.zip).

1. Load the C# project file, `OutSystems.IbanChecker.csproj`, using a supported IDE.

    Files in the project:

    * **IIbanChecker.cs**: Defines a public interface named `IIbanChecker`, decorated with the `OSInterface` attribute. The interface has a single method named `Parse`, which takes an IBAN string value as input and returns an `Iban` struct. `Parse` is exposed as a server action to your ODC apps and libraries.

    * **IbanChecker.cs**: Defines a public class named `IbanChecker` that implements the `IIbanChecker` interface. The class is a convenient wrapper for the `IbanNet` library, an [open-source library](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet) that provides functionality for parsing and validating IBANs. The class has a private field named `_parser`, which is an instance of the `IIbanParser` interface.

    * **Iban.cs** Defines a struct named `Iban`, decorated with the `OSStructure` attribute. The struct has four public properties: `Country`, `Bban`, `BankIdentifier`, and `BranchIdentifier`. `Iban` is exposed as a structure to your ODC apps and libraries.

1. Edit the code to meet your use case. If your project requires unit tests, modify the examples found in `../OutSystems.IbanChecker.UnitTests/IbanCheckerTests.cs` accordingly.

1. Run the Powershell script `generate_upload_package.ps1` to generate `ExternalLibrary.zip`. Rename as required.

1. Upload the generated ZIP file to the ODC Portal. See the [External Logic feature documentation](intro.md) for guidance on how to do this.

#### IBAN (International Bank Account Number) checker: Advanced version

1. Download and unzip the [advanced template file from the GitHub repository](https://github.com/OutSystems/OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK-templates/blob/main/advanced_template.zip).

1. Load the C# project file, `OutSystems.IbanChecker.csproj`, using a supported IDE.

    Files in the project:

     * **IIbanChecker.cs**: Defines a public interface named `IIbanChecker` decorated with the `OSInterface` attribute. The interface has four methods:
    
        * `Parse`: Takes an IBAN string as input and returns an `Iban` struct.
        * `TryParse`: Attempts to parse an IBAN string as input and returns a boolean success indicator along with the parsed `Iban` struct.
        * `Validate`: Takes an IBAN string as input as checks it against a specific rule and a list of rejected countries.
        * `Format`: Takes an `Iban` struct and an optional format string as input and returns a formatted string representation of the IBAN.

        Each method is exposed as a server action to your ODC apps and libraries.

    * **IbanChecker.cs**: Defines a public class named `IbanChecker` that implements the `IIbanChecker` interface. The class is a convenient wrapper for the `IbanNet` library, an [open-source library](https://github.com/skwasjer/IbanNet) that provides functionality for parsing and validating IBANs. The class contains private fields `_parser` and `_validator`, which are instances of the `IIbanParser` and `IIbanValidator` interfaces. The constructor initializes these instances for use in the class methods.

    * **Structures/Iban.cs** Defines a struct named `Iban`, decorated with the `OSStructure` attribute. The struct has four public properties: `Country`, `Bban`, `BankIdentifier`, and `BranchIdentifier`. It's exposed as a structure to your ODC apps and libraries.

    * **Structures/IbanCountry.cs** Defines a struct named `IbanCountry`, decorated with the `OSStructure` attribute. The struct has five public properties: `TwoLetterISORegionName`, `DisplayName`, `NativeName`, `EnglishName`, and `DomesticAccountNumberExample`. It's exposed as a structure to your ODC apps and libraries.

    * **Structures/ValidationResult.cs** Defines a struct named `ValidationResult`, decorated with the `OSStructure` attribute. The struct has three public properties: `AttemptedValue`, `Country`, and `Error`. It's exposed as a structure to your ODC apps and libraries.

    * **CustomRules/RejectedCountriesRule.cs**: Defines a custom IBAN validation rule, `RejectCountryRule`, to reject specified country codes. It also defines an associated error result class, `CountryNotAcceptedError`, for handling rejected countries.

1. Edit the code to meet your use case. If your project requires unit tests, modify the examples found in `../OutSystems.IbanChecker.UnitTests/IbanCheckerTests.cs` accordingly.

1. Run the Powershell script `generate_upload_package.ps1` to generate `ExternalLibrary.zip`. Rename as required.

1. Upload the generated ZIP file to the ODC Portal. See the [External Logic feature documentation](intro.md#upload-and-publish-the-external-logic) for guidance on how to do this.

## Best Practices

### Use with the Private Gateway feature

You can connect your external library to private data and private services ("endpoints") that aren't accessible by the internet by using the [Private Gateway feature](../../configuration-management/private-gateway.md).

Once you've configured a private gateway to your network, you can use the connected endpoint(s) in your custom code using the hostname defined by the environment variable `SECURE_GATEWAY`. You use that hostname in conjunction with the configured ports.

For example, if you want to connect to a REST API endpoint on port 8080 you could use a string to define the Base URL as `$"https://{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SECURE_GATEWAY")}:8080/"` if the endpoint is connected to cloud-connector over TLS/SSL or `http` if it's not.

Ensure that your code file includes the `using System;` directive at the top to have access to the `System` namespace, which is necessary for utilizing the `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` method.

### App architecture

The server actions you build in the OutSystems visual language execute directly in the [ODC Runtime](../../architecture/intro.md/#runtime), the same infrastructure as the app.

Server actions your apps consume through external logic are slightly different in that they execute outside of this Runtime infrastructure. Each time your app calls a server action exposed by an external library, it makes an HTTPS call to an external service. This adds a small latency to the execution time of the server action. You should consider this when building an ODC app that uses external logic: is there any way to minimize the number of calls to the server action(s)?

## Troubleshooting

All validation of your external logic is done when [uploading the ZIP file to the Portal](intro.md#upload-and-publish-the-external-logic).

Use the [error page documentation](../../../error/elg/intro.md) for guidance.
