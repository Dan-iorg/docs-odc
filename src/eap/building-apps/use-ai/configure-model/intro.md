# Configure your AI models

## Overview

The AI Agent Builder uses AI models from [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/ai-services/openai-service) and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to create agents and build generative AI applications.

The information in this section is intended for administrators and dev-ops engineers with a good working knowledge of configuring AI services in Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock. Be sure to check the prerequisite sections for each service. 

To configure your AI models and use them in the AI Agent Builder you must: 

1. Set up your AI service in [Azure](configure-aws-model.md) or [AWS](configure-aws-model.md), depending on the model you choose.

1. Get your registration keys and endpoint access for your model from the console.

3. Add your access keys and end-point access information to the AI Agent Builder.

4. [Create your agents](../create-agent.md) in the AI Agent Builder.
