* Obtain the secret key and access key from the AWS console.

* Gain access to the AI Agent Builder app with the **Configurator** role assigned in the ODC portal.

    * **Description** - (Optional) Description of the AI model.

    * **Region**-  Choose the geographical[ AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html) the account can use.

        This region must match the region specified when creating the user in the AWS console.

    * **Model** - Choose the model you want to add to the app.\

    * **Access key** - The access key ID of the user created while setting up the Amazon Bedrock FMs.

    * **Secret key** - The secret key of the user created while setting up the Amazon Bedrock FMs.

    For more information about managing access keys, refer to [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

1. Click **Test connection and save**.

Once you've added the model, you are redirected to the **Configurations** page. A confirmation message is displayed confirming that the AI model has been added successfully. You can also view the newly added model on the **Configurations** page. If adding the model fails, an error message is displayed.

You can **edit** the fields of the model and **delete** the model from the AI Agent Builder app in case you no longer need the AI model or have changed providers.
