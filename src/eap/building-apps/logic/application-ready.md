# On Application Ready

Your app runs the **On Application Ready** during the loading of the app. Use **On Application Ready** to set up the app, for example, to initialize variables and mobile plugins.

The **On Application Ready** action runs asynchronously, and doesn't block the render of the screens.

To add the **On Application Ready** action to a Mobile or Web App do the following in ODC Studio:

1. In your app, open the **Logic** tab.

1. Right-click the **Client Actions** node in the tree and select **Add System Event** > **On Application Ready**.
