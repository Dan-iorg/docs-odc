# Combine data from different sources

In OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC), you can combine data from different entities and distinct data sources in an aggregate to provide a unified view. ODC Data Fabric retrieves data from these sources and performs in-memory operations to achieve the desired results.

Some benefits of data mashup are: 

* Simplified process: You can drag and drop data from different sources, creating custom logic to combine data. This helps you save time and effort. 
* Improved data analysis: You can leverage data from various databases to gain deeper insights and make better business decisions.
* Increased flexibility: You get greater flexibility in data analysis and reporting.

You can use [data fabric](../../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/platform-architecture/intro.md#data-fabric) to access and integrate data into your apps along with [data fabric connectors](../../../integration-with-systems/external-databases/intro.md) for integrations. Data Fabric processes all your external system data uniformly, with no persistent storage within Data Fabric or ODC architecture.

To better understand queries in data mashup, refer [writing better queries in aggregates ](queries.md).
