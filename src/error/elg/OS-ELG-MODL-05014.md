# OS-ELG-MODL-05014

## Error message

`More than one structure, '<StructureName>', was found with the name '<Name>'.`

## Cause

The error occurs because multiple structures are using the same name in the `Name` parameter of the `OSStructure` attribute.

## Impact

You must fix this error before you can publish the external library. Once you've fixed it, you must create and upload a new ZIP file.

## Recommended action

To solve this issue, you should ensure that each structure with the `OSStructure` attribute has a unique name. For example:

**Before**

    [OSStructure("MyStructure")]
    public struct MyStructure1
    {
        public int Value;
    }

    [OSStructure("MyStructure")]
    public struct MyStructure2
    {
        public float Value;
    }

**After**

    [OSStructure("MyStructure1")]
    public struct MyStructure1
    {
        public int Value;
    }

    [OSStructure("MyStructure2")]
    public struct MyStructure2
    {
        public float Value;
    }


In the corrected example, the `OSStructure` attribute names are unique: `MyStructure1` and `MyStructure2`. This resolves the error.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-ELG-MODL-05014).
